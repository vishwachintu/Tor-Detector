## Introduction

This Python script allows you to detect onion websites, also known as Tor hidden services, and also know as dark websites by checking if a given URL follows the specific pattern used by these websites. It's a valuable tool for digital forensics, cybersecurity, and investigative work.

## How it Works

The script employs regular expressions to match URLs against the pattern commonly used by onion websites. If the URL matches the pattern, it's identified as an onion website.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Run the script with Python 3, providing the URL you want to check as an argument.

   ```bash
   python tor_detector.py
   ```

3. The script will output whether the URL is an onion website or not.

## Example

```bash
$ python detect_onion.py 
The URL http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion is an onion website.
```

## Dependencies

This script has no external dependencies beyond Python 3.
